Project Title: To-Do List Web Application with CRUD and Task Assignment Features

Project Description:

This project is a dynamic To-Do List web application designed to streamline task management through a user-friendly interface and robust functionality. The application supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing users to easily manage their tasks. Additionally, it features a "Done" functionality, where completed tasks are visually marked by striking through the text.

A standout feature of this application is the task assignment functionality. Each task created includes an "Assign" button, which, when clicked, opens a dialogue box prompting the user to enter an email ID. The specified task is then sent as an email to the provided address, enabling easy delegation of tasks to others.

The applicationâ€™s front-end is built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, providing a responsive and intuitive user experience. The back-end is powered by Python and Flask, ensuring efficient data processing and handling. MySQL is used as the database management system, ensuring reliable data storage and retrieval.

This project demonstrates strong skills in full-stack web development, combining both front-end and back-end technologies to create a functional and efficient task management solution.
